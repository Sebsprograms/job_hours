# About The Project

Trades & shop-workers often work on multiple jobs daily. If they do not carefully tack the hours spent on each job, it can lead to issues when it is time write invoices or bill contractors.

Initially, I am aiming just to add a job name and hours spent for the test user (me). Once I have the endpoints to do that I will display them and modify them with a front-end.
